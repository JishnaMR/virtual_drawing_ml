# AI-Powered Virtual Drawing Interface

This project leverages real-time gesture recognition using a web camera to create a virtual drawing application. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it enables users to draw and control presentations using hand movements, offering an interactive and hands-free experience ideal for teaching and virtual presentations. The system tracks hand and finger movements to create on-screen drawings, making it a versatile tool for visual storytelling and education.
